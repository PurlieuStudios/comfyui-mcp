# ComfyUI MCP Server - Minimal Configuration
# Quick start configuration with only required settings

[comfyui]
# ComfyUI server URL (required)
url = "http://localhost:8188"

# That's it! This is the minimum configuration needed.
# All other settings use sensible defaults:
#   - timeout: 120.0 seconds
#   - api_key: none (not required for local ComfyUI)
#   - output_dir: not set (images saved to ComfyUI's default location)

# To use this configuration:
#   1. Copy this file to 'comfyui.toml' in your project root
#   2. Update the URL if your ComfyUI runs on a different host/port
#   3. Start using the ComfyUI MCP Server!

# For more configuration options, see:
#   - comfyui.example.toml (comprehensive example with all options)
#   - comfyui.dev.toml (development settings)
#   - comfyui.prod.toml (production settings)
