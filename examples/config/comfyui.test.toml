# ComfyUI MCP Server Configuration - Testing Environment
# Optimized for automated testing and CI/CD pipelines

[comfyui]
# Test ComfyUI server (typically a mock or test instance)
# For CI/CD, this might be a containerized ComfyUI instance
url = "http://localhost:8188"

# Short timeout for unit/integration tests
# Tests should complete quickly to maintain fast feedback loops
timeout = 30.0

# Test output directory (cleaned between test runs)
output_dir = "./test_output"

# API key for test environment (set via environment variable)
# In CI/CD:
#   export COMFYUI_API_KEY=test-api-key-for-ci
# Never commit real credentials to version control!

# Additional test configuration notes:
#
# 1. Mock Server Setup:
#    For unit tests, use the mock ComfyUI server provided in tests/
#    No real ComfyUI instance required for most tests.
#
# 2. Integration Tests:
#    For integration tests, ensure a real ComfyUI instance is running
#    at the URL specified above. Use Docker for consistency:
#      docker run -d -p 8188:8188 comfyanonymous/comfyui
#
# 3. CI/CD Pipeline:
#    - Set COMFYUI_URL via environment variable if needed
#    - Use short timeout to fail fast on errors
#    - Clean test_output directory before each test run
#    - Mock external dependencies when possible
#
# 4. Test Data:
#    - Store test workflows in tests/fixtures/
#    - Use deterministic seeds for reproducible results
#    - Keep test images small to speed up tests
